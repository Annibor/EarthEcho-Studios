- Being able to provide a clear easly fond contact option for costumers for booking or asking questions.
- Have correct and easily understandable information for her costumers as well as for potential costumers.

#### As a General user/costumer

Users and potential costumers visiting EarthEcho Studios wanted to:

### Colors

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website.

- [Color palette]()

I then used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/#283618) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette.

- [Tints and Shades]()

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

- [Color Contrast]()

### Design Philosophy/ Features

The design of EarthEcho Studios website have been carefully thought out to create a user-friendly and an engaging expreience, Key design elements and principles include:

- **Header**: A responsive navigation bar, that adapts to different screens sizes, ensuring easy access to all pages. The navbar collapse into a dropdown menu, when a certain sreen size is used, and the navbar is then reached by the classic burger icon.

![Header Desktop]

![Header Mobile]

- **Navigation Buttons**: A responsive section of links to all pages of the website. As it is localised just above the footer, it also have a button "Back to top" so users don't have to scroll to the top of each page.

- **Footer**: A responsive footer that contains an address to the business, social media links, a newsletter sign-up option and copyright details.

### Future Features

Future features for the webpage are:

- Catagoritation of the gallery into different photography catagories.
- A carousel of reviews from former costumers, to build trust.
- Expansion of the contact form witg optiions for different types of photoshoots.
- Being able to buy order and pay some of the photoshoots right away.

## Testing

- Throughout the whole development of the webpage, I've made tests in:

### DevTools

- Troughout the development I've used Devtools to inspect and test the website to be able to make the best I could for it.

### Lighthouse

#### Issues

- I've used Lighthouse to test the website where I got the error about the color on the navbar text. The colors made it through the Contrast Color checker, but in Lighthouse it was ruled as an issue.

![Issue with text color](<(docs/testing/issue-text-gallery.png)

- Another error I got was the image size for the Home page and the Galley page, so I tried to make them even smaller, without loosing the quality of the images. In the next section are the results of the resizing and further opimization.

![Issue Gallery Page](docs/testing/issues-img-gallery.png)

#### Results

- One of the hardest part of building this website where the images. It took a lot of effort and many redos before I got this result. Not all of them are 100% becasue of the amount of images on some of the pages, but I came to the conclution that if I would change the images even further, they would loose their quality, and therfore are the results between 96-100% in performance.

### Manual testing

- I have tested the website in Safari, Brave and Google Chrome without running in to any issues.

## Deployment

I deployed early to ba able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the [repository](https://github.com/Annibor/EarthEcho-Studios) and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under [Deplyments](https://github.com/Annibor/EarthEcho-Studios/deployments).
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.

## Credits

### Content

- The EarthEcho Studios website draws inspiratind fron Jonas Schmedtmann's Omnifood Project, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/final).

- The header and navbar design were influenced by the Omnifood Project ans Love Running Project available at [Github](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-v3/tree/main).

- The layout for the gallery page is inspired by the exceptional work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made costumizations for the layout. For example adjusting the box-shadow, the gap, and choosen specific images for this website. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design. I choose to do like this because it was the best design for the specific page of the website.

- The layout for images and the text to each image on the Product page are inspired by the work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made the privious mentioned costumizations for the layout on this page, but also including the text boxexsunder each images. The box-shadow then lays under the image and the text-box like it is one component. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design.
