## Planning & developmnet

<!-- Needs edit-->

In the process of creating EarthEcho Studios, I followed a plan that revolved around Sophie's vision for her photography business. The development of the website had the following goals to aim for:

### Project Goals

2. **Costumer Base**: Making it easier for potential clients to find ans connect with Sophie and therfore growing her local costumer base.

3. **Booking Platform**: Making a way for costumers to cotact and book a photoshoot with Sophie, based on thir own preferenses.

4. **Costumer Interaction**: Offer a clear and accessible contact information for the costumers.

5. **Information Accessibility**: Make sure both new as well as existing costumers easily can access relevant informatino about EarthEcho Studios and the services Sophie have.

### User-Centered Approach

#### As a buisness Owner

Sophie, as the owner of EarthEcho Studios ans the website, she had the following objectives:

- To create an online presence to be able to promote her photography and her business.
- Expand the costumer base by showcasing her work online.
- Being able to provide a clear easly fond contact option for costumers for booking or asking questions.
- Have correct and easily understandable information for her costumers as well as for potential costumers.

#### As a General user/costumer

Users and potential costumers visiting EarthEcho Studios wanted to:

- Get to know the photographer Sophie, to be able to figure out if she's the right fit for them.
- Find contact information and being able to get in contact with Sophie.
- Being able to see a gallery/portpholio as well as informatino about the different kinds of photoshoots Sophie offers.

#### As a New User

New users landing on ErathEcho Studios website aimed to:

- Discover information about the photographer, Sophie.
- Learn about tje different products offered.
- View a gallery/portpholio of Sophies photoshoots.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes for the website by using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created one wireframe for mobile, tablet and desktop on each page of the website.

#### **Home page**

- [Wireframes for tablet](docs/wireframes/wireframe-tablet-home.png)
- [Wireframes for desktop](docs/wireframes/wireframe-desktop-home.png)

#### **Gallery page**

### Colors

- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website.

- ![Color palette](docs/screenshots/color-palette.png)

I then used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/#283618) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette.

- ![Tints](docs/screenshots/tints-palette.png)
- ![Shades](docs/screenshots/shades-palette.png)

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

- ![Color Contrast](docs/screenshots/color-contrast-checker.png)

- At first I used all the colors from the color palette, but once I made the color contrast checks, I choose to use some tints and shades from the original colors instead.
  - Two tints from the color #fefae0 I used where #fffdf0 and #fffef9.
  - Two shades I used from the color #bc6c25 where #96561e and #4b2b0f.

### Fonts

I used a font called Montserrat for headings and subheadings on the website, and for the text I used a font called Lato. I added Inter and Sans-serif as fallback fonts on the texts, and Sans-serif as a fallback for the headings and subheadings.

### Design Philosophy/ Features

The design of EarthEcho Studios website have been carefully thought out to create a user-friendly and an engaging expreience, Key design elements and principles include:

- **Header**: A responsive navigation bar, that adapts to different screens sizes, ensuring easy access to all pages. The navbar collapse into a dropdown menu, when a certain sreen size is used, and the navbar is then reached by the classic burger icon.

![Header Desktop](docs/screenshots/header-desktop.png)
![Header Tablet](docs/screenshots/header-tablet.png)
![Header Mobile](docs/screenshots/header-mobile.png)

![Header Mobile]

- **Navigation Buttons**: A responsive section of links to all pages of the website. As it is localised just above the footer, it also have a button "Back to top" so users don't have to scroll to the top of each page.

![Navigation buttons Desktop](docs/screenshots/header-desktop.png)

### Future Features

Future features for the webpage are:

- Smooth scrolling, to improve user experience.
- Catagoritation of the gallery into different photography catagories.
- A carousel of reviews from former costumers, to build trust.
- Expansion of the contact form witg optiions for different types of photoshoots.
- Being able to buy order and pay some of the photoshoots right away.

## Testing

- Throughout the whole development of the webpage, I've made tests in:

### DevTools

- Troughout the development I've used Devtools to inspect and test the website to be able to make the best I could for it.

### Lighthouse

#### Issues

- I've used Lighthouse to test the website where I got the error about the color on the navbar text. The colors made it through the Contrast Color checker, but in Lighthouse it was ruled as an issue.

![Issue with text color](<(docs/testing/issue-text-gallery.png)

- Another error I got was the image size for the Home page and the Galley page, so I tried to make them even smaller, without loosing the quality of the images. In the next section are the results of the resizing and further opimization.

![Issue Home Page](docs/testing/issue-imgs-home.png)
![Issue Gallery Page](docs/testing/issues-img-gallery.png)

#### Results

- One of the hardest part of building this website where the images. It took a lot of effort and many redos before I got this result. Not all of them are 100% becasue of the amount of images on some of the pages, but I came to the conclution that if I would change the images even further, they would loose their quality, and therfore are the results between 96-100% in performance.

- I've tested the website from an Iphone safari as well.

## Deployment

I deployed early to ba able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the [repository](https://github.com/Annibor/EarthEcho-Studios) and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under [Deplyments](https://github.com/Annibor/EarthEcho-Studios/deployments).
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.

### Content

- The EarthEcho Studios website draws inspiratind fron Jonas Schmedtmann's Omnifood Project, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/final).

- The header and navbar design were influenced by the Omnifood Project and Love Running Project available at [Github](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-v3/tree/main).

- The layout for the gallery page is inspired by the exceptional work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made costumizations for the layout. For example adjusting the box-shadow, the gap, and choosen specific images for this website. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design. I choose to do like this because it was the best design for the specific page of the website.

- The layout for images and the text to each image on the Product page are inspired by the work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made the privious mentioned costumizations for the layout on this page, but also including the text boxexsunder each images. The box-shadow then lays under the image and the text-box like it is one component. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design.

  - The grid box used in the product page are inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's Omnifood Project, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/final).

- This README is based on a README created by Davis Calikes, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/davidcalikes/portfolio-project-one#readme).

### Special Thanks

- **Michel**: A heartfelt thank you to my amazing boyfriend for unwavering support throughout the wholr project.

- **Pierre: Code Institute Student**:Pierre have been an invauable collaborator, offering discussions on project-related topics as well as discussions about code in general.

- **Gemma & Roman: Code Institute Tutor support**: A big thank you to Gemma and Roman for giving me help and guidance during the development.

- **David: Code Institute**: To David who quickly answerd any questions I had about the project, so I could keep developing and finish this project.

## What I've learned

- While developing this website I've learned a lot of things, not only the developing process but also about myself.
- One big thing I've learned the hard way is to do the documentation in README throughout the developing. I only did a breif structure with basic information at the benning.
  -I've learned the basics of using flex-grid and flex-box, which have been really fun to work with.
- I've learned how to debug and test the code that I'm working on.
- I've learned that it's okey to make misstakes, because that's when you learn the most.
- I didn't know how to use Git or GitHub before starting this project, but now I feel that I know the basics of how to use them.
- Another thing is that testing the code, debugging and doing research takes most of the time of the whole process.
- On a personal level I've learned the learning process takes time, and by doing the same thing over and over for prectice and being curious is the best way to learn.
