### Colors

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website.

- [Color palette]()

I then used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/#283618) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette.

- [Tints and Shades]()

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

- [Color Contrast]()

### Design Philosophy/ Features

The design of EarthEcho Studios website have been carefully thought out to create a user-friendly and an engaging expreience, Key design elements and principles include:

- **Header**: A responsive navigation bar, that adapts to different screens sizes, ensuring easy access to all pages. The navbar collapse into a dropdown menu, when a certain sreen size is used, and the navbar is then reached by the classic burger icon.

- **Navigation Buttons**: A responsive section of links to all pages of the website. As it is localised just above the footer, it also have a button "Back to top" so users don't have to scroll to the top of each page.

## Credits

### Content

- The EarthEcho Studios website draws inspiratind fron Jonas Schmedtmann's Omnifood Project, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/final).

- The header and navbar design were influenced by the Omnifood Project ans Love Running Project available at [Github](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-v3/tree/main).

- The layout for the gallery page is inspired by the exceptional work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made costumizations for the layout. For example adjusting the box-shadow, the gap, and choosen specific images for this website. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design. I choose to do like this because it was the best design for the specific page of the website.

- The layout for images and the text to each image on the Product page are inspired by the work of George W. Park, available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom). I made the privious mentioned costumizations for the layout on this page, but also including the text boxexsunder each images. The box-shadow then lays under the image and the text-box like it is one component. I opted to use the flex-box code from the original design.
