### Content

- The website is loosley based on Jonas Schmedtmanns Omnifood Project. https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/final
- The header and navbar is based on Omnifood project and Love Running project.
- The Gallery pages images layout is copied from an amazing work by George W. Park https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/vdqYom. I changed the box- shadow, used imgages choosen for this website and choosen another gap. I choose to copy the most part of this layout because it where the absolutley best layout for the website. The original code is written with Css grid and with a fallback to flexbox, but I choose only to use the flexbox code for the website.
